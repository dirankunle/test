                                        Collocation is the addition of new customers to an existing tower. These customer could be mobile network operators, Internet service providers, surety functions or private corporations needing point-to-point secure communications. Lease amendments involve adding additional equipment or providing ancillary services at existing towers for existing customers.

                                    Where collocation is not available we construct towers for our customers, enabling them to expand their networks. We handle every step of the project to build a site specific to the customer's requirement. This includes    site analysis (Land surveys, environmental site assessment, and geo-technical analysis, zoning and permitting), site acquisition, permitting and legal due diligence, site development, construction management, and equipment installation.
